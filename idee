wimp = wimp is not mario party (shhh don't tell anyone
    but actually it is...)

"modern, 21st cent mp for autists"
- ok, we can take soooome fun action games...
- actually, the games I had in mind take 15 minutes
    or sth; much too long - maybe in extra mode?
- ok, new tagline, get ready:
- "AN OPEN-SOURCE, PURE PYTHONIC PARTYING SOLUTION". eh?

features:
- main feature: openness about data, savestates etc.!
    e.g. show x/y-vectors at ball-wrestling-game

- internet play (accompanied by skype is recommended)
- boards (useful for other people to reuse/add to!)
- elos for everyone (used for random pairing if ever needed)
- 2d, minimalistic (though some shading effects would be nice)
- 3 categories: reddit gold, dogecoin and karma (=luck)
- needs more slots
- definitive elements: boo (can choose from who to steal);
    position-swap
    CHANCE TIME!!!

minigames:
- mg should be adaptable to 2/3/4 and possibly more!
    so the pool for each in 2/3/4 should be
    >= 1/4 * (all pools) ! (i.e. no # of players is preferred)
- action-minigames:
    * tetris vs
    * bowserfrucht
    * minecart mash-n-lenk
    * memory-pipes (pipes lead to ran locations)
    * ballroll (ball-wrestling-game)
    * some luck minigames for 'balance'
        (BUT: each mg has a 'luck rating'! ideally by users)
- non-action-minigames:
    * ok what would actually work:
        * chess variant on small board
        * liars' poker (BUT: single-elimination!)
        * 
    * ones of chess variants, mini-go?
    * cgs: commune, durak, ddz, skat, etc.
    * vector racer

promotion:
